## breadbake

- what am i supposed to do??
  - make state diagram
  - implement the state diagram
    - peek at microwave/prod/microwave.cpp for setup
  - make tests (using gmocks)

## algorithm 1

- part 3
  - look up 3 sorting algorithm
  - implement `ComputeDifferenceBetweenMaxAndMinSumOfKElements_N` for algorithm 1, 2, and 3.
    - \+ tests

## algorithm 2

### part 1

- cp POC dir to own repo
- standard implementation of linked list using `void*`

## part 2

- use the code from part 1 to make a "memory manager"

## algorithm 3

- use algorithm 2 part 1 to make a stack and a queue
  - > can be skipped due to 4

## algorithm 4

- make a binary tree inspired by the linked list
  - when they talk about algorithms you can look them up
