i've been having trouble with some assignments due to my tendency to over complicate things.
i managed to deal with it for a bit in my previous school but i somehow am unable to figure out why this time.

to help combat this issue ronald and i agreed for me to discus the content of the assignment before i start working on it so i don't go down a unnecessary rabbit hole again.
