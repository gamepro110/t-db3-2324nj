# feedpulse 2023-09-22 ronald

ronald was satisfied with my `object diagram` and `class diagram`.</br>
he did note that later in this semester there should be a HAL (hardware abstraction layer) between code and hardware.</br>
i also noticed i made an mistake with the indicator, it should shows the current floor and not set to on or off like an led.
